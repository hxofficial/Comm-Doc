# Comm-Doc

## Overview

To create this project we first collaborated on Goolge Docs to write out of all of the content. Hani wrote Task 1 and 2, and Jamie wrote Task 3 and troubleshooting.

We followed tutorials in order to learn Markdown as it was our first time writing in the language.

We chose to create this tutorial on common tasks used in MySQL Workbench in order to strengten our abilites to communicate complex informaiton about databases in a simple way.
