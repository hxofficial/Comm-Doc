# Comm-Doc

## Overview

This repository contains user documentation written in markdown that tells users how to create schemas, create tables, enter data, establish relationships between tables, and delete schemas in MySQL Workbench.

To create this project we first collaborated on Goolge Docs to write out of all of the content. Hani wrote Task 1 and 2, and Jamie wrote Task 3 and troubleshooting.

We followed tutorials in order to learn Markdown as it was our first time writing in the language.

In our “COMP 2350 - Introduction to Database Management” course this semester we learned how to use MySQLWorkbench. For this user documentation, we wanted to create a guide that would have helped us in our first few classes of the course.

We chose to create this tutorial on common tasks used in MySQL Workbench in order to strengten our abilites to communicate complex informaiton about databases in a simple way. Writing this documentation helped improve our ability to commminicate wiht users about interacting with software in the future.
