### **Schema**

Schema is a database object that contains a collection of tables, views, stored procedures, and other database objects.

### **Table**

Table is a database object that stores data in a set of named rows and columns. They are used to organize and store data in a structured manner. Each table has a unique name and is associated with a specific database schema.

### **Row**

"Row" is a horizontal record in a table that represents a single instance of data. Each row in a table contains a set of related values for the columns defined in the table.

### **Column**

"Column" is a vertical data element in a table that represents a specific attribute or data field. Each column in a table is defined by a name, a data type, and optional constraints such as nullability, uniqueness, and default values.

### **Primary Key**

"PK" in database stands for "Primary Key." A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identifies each record in a table of a database. The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record in the table is unique and identifiable.

### **Foreign Key**

"FK" in database stands for "Foreign Key." A foreign key is a field in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values of the columns that they share.
