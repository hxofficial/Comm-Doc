## **Reference Column**

A Reference Column is the column referenced by a Foreign Key.

## **Reference Table**

A Reference Table is the table that contains the Foreign Key.

## **Row**

"Row" is a horizontal record in a table that represents a single instance of data. Each row in a table contains a set of related values for the columns defined in the table.

## **Schema**

Schema is a database object that contains a collection of tables, views, stored procedures, and other database objects.
