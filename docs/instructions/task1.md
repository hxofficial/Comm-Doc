- **Type** a name for your new schema. We named our schema "full_stack_web_development".
  **_Note: _** Make sure to choose a name that is descriptive and easy to remember and do not change the character set and the collation setting.

- **Click** on the "Apply" button, after you have entered your schema name.  
  Once you click on the apply button you will get a pop-up message that shows you MYSQL query which is the command related to the task you are doing manually.  
   &nbsp;  

- **Click** "Apply", then "Close".
